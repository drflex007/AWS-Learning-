EBS ( Elastic Block Storage )

Two types of blocks store devices are available for EC2 -->

1. Elastic Block Store 
   ---> Persistent 
   ---> Network attached Virtual Drive.
2. Instance store backed EC2. Basically the virtual hard drive on the host allocated to the EC2 instance. 
   ---> Limited to 10 GB per Drive. 
   ---> Ephermeral Storage ( Non-Persistent Storage )
   ---> The EC2 instance can't be stopped, can only be rebooted or terminated, terminate will delete data. 

Root/Boot Volume ---> that can be attacched to the O.S.

EBS backed - means OS is resided in the EBS. 

EBS Volume behave like RAW, Unformatted, external block storage devices that you can attach to your EC2 instance.
---> EBS Volumes are block storage devices suitable for database style data that requires frequent reads & writes.
---> EBS Volumes are attached to your EC2 instances through the AWS Network, like Virtual hard drives. 
---> An EBS Volume can attach to a Single EC2 instance Only at a time. 
---> Both EBS Volume and EC2 instance must be in the same AZ. 

An EBS Volume data is replicated by AWS across multiple servers in the Same AZ to prevent data loss resulting from any Single AWS Component Failure.

EBS Volume Types----
1.  SSD ( Solid State Drive ) Backed Volume ( Bootable Drive )
    i - General Purpose SSD ( gp2 ) ( Defaullt Value  30 GB for Windows EC2 instance )
    ii- Provisioned IOPS SSD ( io1 ) ( Best IOPS provided in this version )
2.  HDD ( Hard disk Drive ) Backed Volume  ( Non- Bootable Drive )
    i - Throughput Optimized HDD ( st1 )
    ii - Cold HDD ( sc1 )
3.  Magnetic Standard ( after 2012 EBS Standard drive beacome magnetic standard ) ( Bootable Drive )
we can define EBS volune on the basis of two categorary 
i - IPOS - Input Output per second. 
ii - Throughput - MB/s


General Purpose SSD ( gp2 )
---> GP2 is the default EBS Volume type for the amazon EC2 Instance. 
---> GP2 Volumes are backed by SSDs
---> General Purpose, balances both price and performance.
---> Ratio of 3IOPS/GB with upto 10,000 IOPS. 
---> Boot Volume having low latency.
---> Volume Size - 1 GB - 16 TB
---> Price - $ 0.10 GB/month ( Price vary through the region )

Provisioned  IOPS SSD ( io1 )
---> These Volumes are ideal for both IOPS intensive and throughput intensive workloads that require extremely low latency or for mission Critical applications.
---> Designed for I/O intensive applications such as large relational or NoSQL Databases. 
---> Use if you need more than 10,000 IOPS.
---> Can provision upto 32,000 IOPS per volume ( 64,000 IOPS )
---> Volume Size - 4 GB -- 16 TB.
---> Price -- $ 0.125/GB/month ( Price vary through the region )

Throughput Optimized HDD ( st1 )
---> st1 is backed by Hard disk drives and is ideal for frequently accessed, throughput intensive workloads with large datasets.
---> st1 Volumes deliver performance in term of throughput, measured in MB/s.
---> Big data, Data Warehouse, log processing.
---> It cannot be a Boot Volume.
---> Can provisioned upto 500 IOPS per volume. 
---> Volume Size - 500GB - 16 TB 
---> Price - $ 0.045 GB/Month.

Cold HDD ( sc1 )
sc1  is also backed by HDD and provides the lowest cost per GB of all EBS Volume types. 
---> Lowest Cost Storage for infreqent access Workloads.
---> used for file servers.
---> Cannot be a boot volume.
---> Can provisioned upto 250 IOPS per volume
---> Volume size - 500 GB - 16 TB.
---> Price -- $ 0.025/GB/Month.


Magnetic Standard
---> Lowest Cost per GB of all EBS Volume type that is Bootable. 
---> Magnetic Volumes are Ideal for Workloads where data is accessed infrequently, and applications where the lowest storage cost is important. 
---> Price - $ 0.05 per GB/month.
---> Volume Size -- 1 GB - 1 TB
---> Max IOPS/Volume - 40 - 200

EBS Snapshot 
---> EBS Snapshots are point-in-time Images/Copies of your EBS Volume.
---> Any data written to the volume after the snapshot process is initiated, will not be included in the resulting snapshot ( but will be included in future, incremental update).
---> Per AWS account, upto 5000 EBS Volumes Can be created.
---> Per account, upto 10,000 EBS Snapshots can be created. 
---> EBS Snapshots are stored on S3, however you cannot access them directly. You Can Only access them through EC2 APIs. 
---> While EBS Volumes are AZ Specific, Snapshots are Region Specific. 
---> Any AZ in Region can use Snapshots to Create EBS Volume. 
---> To migrate an EBS from one AZ to another, Create a Snapshot ( Region Specific ) and Create an EBS Volume from the Sanpshot in the intended AZ.
---> You Can Create a Snapshot to an EBS Volume of the Same or Larger Size than the Original Volume Size from Which the snapshot was intially Created. 
---> You can take a Snapshot of a Non-root EBS Volume while the volume is in use on a running EC2 instance.
---> This means you can still access it while the Sanpshot is being processed.
---> However the snapshot will only include data that is already  written to your volume. 
---> The Snapshot is Created Immediately, but it may stay in pending status until the full Snapshot is completed. This may takes, few hours to complete, specically for 
     the first time Sanpshot of a Volume. 
---> During the period, when the Snapshot status is Pending, You can still access the volume (non-root), but I/O might be slower because of the Snapshot activity.
---> While in pending state, an in-progress snapshot will not include data from ongoing reads and write to the volume.
---> To take complete snapshot of your non-root EBS Volume. 
     --> Stop or umount the volume.
 To Create a Snapshot for a Root EBS Volume, You must stop the instance first then take the Snapshot.

---> EBS Snapshot are stored incrementally.
---> For low cost storage on S3, and a Guarantee to be able to fully restore data from the Snapshots.
---> What you need is a Single Snapshot, then further Snapshots will only carry the Changed Blocks(Incremental Updates)
---> Therefore you do not need to have multiple full/complete copies of the Snapshot.
---> You are charged for data transferred to S3 from your EBS Volume you are taking Snapshot.
---> Snapshot stored in S3.
---> First snapshot is a done. Subsequent Snapshots are Incremental.
---> Deleting Sanpshot will only remove data Exculsive to that Snapshot. 

Encryption of EBS Volume
---> EBS encryption is supported on all EBS Volume types and all EC2 instance families.
---> Snapshots of Encrypted Volumes are also encrypted. 
---> Creating an EBS Volume from an Encrypted Snapshot will result it an encrypted volume. 
---> Data Encryption at rest means, encryption data while it is stored on the data storage device. 
---> There are many ways you can encrypt data on an EBS Volume at Rest, While the volume is attached to on EC2 Instance.
    ---> use 3rd party EBS Volume.
    ---> Encryption Tools.
    ---> Use encrypted EBS Volumes.
    ---> Use encryption at the OS Level.
    ---> Encrypt data at the application level before storing it to the volume.
    ---> Use Encrypted file system on the top of the EBS Volume.
 ---> Encrypted Volume are accessed exactly like unencrypted Ones, basically encryption is handled transparently.
 ---> You can attach an encrypted and unencrypted volumes to the same EC2 instance.
 ---> Remember that the EBS Volumes are not physically attached to the EC2 instance, rather they are virtually attached through the EBS infrasturture.
 ---> This means when you encrypt data on an EBS Volume, data is actually. encrypted on the EC2 Instance then transferred, encrypted to be stored on the EBS Volume.
 ---> This means data in transit b/w EC2 and encrypted EBS Volume is also encrypted. 
 ---> There is no direct way to change the encrption state of the volume. 
 ---> To Change the state(indirectly) you need to  following either of the following two ways- 
     i- Attach a new, encrypted, EBS Volume to the EC2 Instance that has the data to be encrypted then,
 ---> Mount the New Volume to the EC2 Instance
 ---> Copy the data from the encrypted volume to the New Volume.
 ---> Both Volumes must be on the same EC2 Instance.
