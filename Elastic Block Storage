Two types of blocks store devices are available for EC2 -->

1. Elastic Block Store 
   ---> Persistent 
   ---> Network attached Virtual Drive.
2. Instance store backed EC2. Basically the virtual hard drive on the host allocated to the EC2 instance. 
   ---> Limited to 10 GB per Drive. 
   ---> Ephermeral Storage ( Non-Persistent Storage )
   ---> The EC2 instance can't be stopped, can only be rebooted or terminated, terminate will delete data. 

Root/Boot Volume ---> that can be attacched to the O.S.

EBS backed - means OS is resided in the EBS. 

EBS Volume behave like RAW, Unformatted, external block storage devices that you can attach to your EC2 instance.
---> EBS Volumes are block storage devices suitable for database style data that requires frequent reads & writes.
---> EBS Volumes are attached to your EC2 instances through the AWS Network, like Virtual hard drives. 
---> An EBS Volume can attach to a Single EC2 instance Only at a time. 
---> Both EBS Volume and EC2 instance must be in the same AZ. 

An EBS Volume data is replicated by AWS across multiple servers in the Same AZ to prevent data loss resulting from any Single AWS Component Failure.
