Autosacling 

Fault Tolerance 
High Availability.

Creating group of EC2 instances that can scale up or down depending on conditions you set. 
---> Enable Elasticity by scaling horizontally through adding or terminating EC2 instances.
---> Autoscaling ensures that you have the right number of AWS EC2 instances for your needs at all time.
---> Autoscaling helps you save cost by cutting down the number of EC2 instances when not needed,and scaling out to add more instances only when it is required. 

Autoscaling Components
1. Launch Configuration --> Like Instance type, AMI, Keypair, Security Group.
2. Autoscaling Group ---> Group Name, Group Size, VPC, Subnet, Health Check Period. 
3. Scaling Policy ---> Metric Type, Target Value.

Autoscaling Balancing
---> If Autoscaling finds that the number of EC2 instances lanched by ASG into Subject AZs is not balanced (EC2 instances are not evenly distributed) Autoscaling do rebalancing
