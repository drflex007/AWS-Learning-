3. Check the health of your Resources.

   --> You can use Route 53 for any Combination of these functions--
      --> For eg. You can use Route 53 both to register your domain name and to route internet traffic for the domain.
      --> or you can use Route 53 to route internet traffic for a domain that you registered with another domain Registrar

When you register a domain with Route 53, the service automatically makes itself the DNS Service for the domain by doing the following :- 
   ---> It creates a hosted zone that has the same name as your domain. 
   ---> It assigns a set of four name servers to the hosted zone, unique to the account. 
       ---> when someone uses a browser to access your website, these name servers inform the browser where to find your Resources, Such as a web server or an Amazon S3 Bucket.
   ---> It gets the name servers from the hosted zone and adds them to the domain.
